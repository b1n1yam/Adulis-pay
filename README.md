## Adulis Pay for android

Adulis pay is a USSD parser app with a focus on usability. Itâ€™s intuitive, simple and now open as ever.
This repo contains the official source code for the app.

I welcome all developers to use the source code to create a platform that will help our comunity get familiarise with the concept of electronic payments and to advocate for a cashless society.

## But why?
I made this project a few years back, hoping it will enhance the user experience of most Ethiopian ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹-based banking services that uses USSD services. These services aimed to reach as much as platforms as possible. But the command-based USSD system has a an issue with user experience. This is an issue with USSD-based systems in general. I aimed to solve this issue by providing an interactive user interface while letting the USSD perform as it would under the hood.

## Creating your own USSD parser

Currently, I was able to integrate **CBE Birr** and **ORO cash** USSD paths.

1. Please make sure that you have **approval** from the integrated banks before publishing your app
